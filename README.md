# HomeBase

## About
This idea started as a simple **knowledge base** website that would be given to house sitters while traveling.
The sitters would be able to see videos on different aspects and quirks of the house so that they could avoid burning the house down or 
ruining the pool while the owners were away. As I began to plan the project with my client, we both agreed that it would be fun to have the 
homepage be an interactive 3D model of the home. The user can click the navigation buttons at the bottom of the page or double-click the elements on 
the model itself! This has been a really fun project to work on and I have learned a lot about Three.js, React Three Fiber, Blender, and React in the process!
