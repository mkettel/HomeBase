# HomeBase

## About
This idea started as a simple knowledge base website given to house sitters while traveling. The sitters can see videos on different aspects and quirks of the house to avoid burning the house down or ruining the pool while the owners are away. As I began to plan the project with my client, we both agreed that it would be fun to have the homepage be an interactive 3D model of the home. The user can click the navigation buttons at the bottom of the page or double-click the elements on the model itself! This project has been very enjoyable and I have learned a lot about Three.js, React Three Fiber, Blender, and React in the process!
